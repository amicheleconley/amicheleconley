- 👋 Hi, I’m @amicheleconley

I have always been fascinated by technology. Ever since I first got my hands on an NES controller at the age of 3, I knew that my life would be shaped by computers. I am a determined and creative problem solver who is always looking for new ways to handle challenges. I feel truly at home when I can combine solution-seeking with my love for all things tech. I know how to formulate a plan, and know how to execute that plan even better. 

When I'm not in front of one of the many screens in my house - be it my self-built PC's two monitors, my laptop, my phone, a Steam Deck, or any number of handheld game consoles - I can be found hiking the great outdoors. I am a passionate proponent of the National Parks, and frequently take time to enjoy the surprising amount of small parks hidden in the nooks and crannies of Northeast Ohio. Some might think these two interests incompatible; but I believe technology can improve our relationship with nature, and vice versa. I'd love to do work which combines both of these worlds someday!

To start to realize my dream and refine my existing hobbyist tech skills, I have enrolled in Tech Elevator's Java cohort. I truly feel like I can never stop learning. I am looking for a fast-moving setting where I can combine my ever-expanding tech expertise with my passion for computers, and help people in the process.
